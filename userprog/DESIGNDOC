The process of argument parsing can be divided into two parts:
	1. Seperate the first argument with the rest, because the first one
		is the name of the executable file and the rest is arguments.
	2. Setup argument stack.

First we copy a new string of the given name, the extract the exe_name 
and pass exe_name and a copy of given name to thread_create.

Then we do the second step (stack-setup) in start_process(), after the
executable file is loaded successfully. 
	1. We use strtok_r() to seperate arguments in filename string and 
		use memcpy() to push them on the stack. The order does not matter.
		But recording address of every argument and the number of arguments
		are essential.
	2. Do word alignment, make sure the stack pointer used next is the
		multiple of 4.
	3. Push a null pointer sentinel.
	4. Push addresses that are recorded in step 1
	5. Push the address of argv[0]
	6. Push the number of arguments.
	7. Push a fake return address which is 0.

Note that the order of arguments is right-to-left, which means the name of
executable file must be at the lowest address.

Way to arrange the elements of argv[] in right order:
	We push the arguments on the stack first, and record addresses. Then scan
	the list backwards and push these addresses on the stack from above to
	bottom.

Way of avoiding overflowing:
	Actually, we don't know how much arguments that user passes to us. So we
	can not pre-allocate enough space for arguments. So we decided to let the
	keep set argument stack until it fails. Then, when the stack pointer 
	reach a space that is invalid, it causes page fault, and we call exit(-1)
	at that moment.


---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

strtok() store the rest string into a static buffer. strtok_r() store the
rest string into the given pointer save_ptr. It is not safe for pintos to 
store a this into a static buffer. And saving it into save_ptr allows us 
to iterate to read argument later.

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.

Advantages:
	1. Make kernel do less operations and save some time for doing arguments
		parsing in kernel.
	2. Make it safer for kernel. If argument parsing is done in shell, it 
		is done in user mode. Since kernel has more access rights, doing it in 
		kernel more may has more risks.
	3. Checking if the arguments and executable file are there first can 
		better avoid kernel failing.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.

Each open file has its own file descriptor in our implementation. The open
files are stored in a list inside each thread opening it, which is unique 
within a single process not the entire OS. This design may enlarge the memory 
cost of each thread struct, but is convenient when dealing with syscalls like 
exit(), since we can easily know which file to close when a process exits.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

In syscall_handler we have implemented "Bad Pointer Checking" to ensure that
"buffer" and "buffer+size" are all valid user addresses. Thus, in read() and
write() we do not need to check the passed pointers.

For read():
If fd is STDOUT_FILENO (1), return -1.
If fd is STDIN_FILENO (0), we call input_getc() to read std input to buffer
and return size. Else, we find fd in fd_list in the current thread by fd_num
, if we cannot find it just return -1. If we find it we call file_read() to 
get the size we actually read. Note that when calling filesys functions, we
need to put it in a critical section, so here our fs_lock plays its role. 

For write():
If fd is STDIN_FILENO (0), return -1.
If fd is STDOUT_FILENO (1), we call putbuf() once to do the std out to console. 
Else, we find the file by fd_num, if we cannot find file, return -1. Else write 
size of bytes to buffer in the critical section by calling file_write().Finally
, return the size we wrote.

For 4096 bytes of data:
The least number is 1, if all bytes are in one page. It may also span 2 pages,
if the some bytes are in one page and some are in another. Thus, the greatest
number of inspections is 2.

For 2 bytes of data:
The least number is 1, and is very likely that it spans only 1 page. It is very
unlikely that it spans 2 pages, but it is still possible. Therefore, the 
greatest number of inspection is 2, the least number is 1.

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

When parent thread creates a child thread, a "child_info" instance containing
information about the child thread is created and put into the child_list
parent thread.
This "child_info" instance contains a semaphore initialize with 0.

When a thread is calling wait on a child thread, we scan the child_list in
parent thread. If we can not find the correspond child thread, return -1.
If it is found, then we check if it has been waited, return -1 if it has been 
waited. 
Only when it is found and has not been waited, the parent thread will call 
sema_down() on that semaphore, because the initial value of the semaphore 
is 0, the parent thread will be blocked.

When the child thread is put into running and call process_exit(), we can 
find parent thread by its parent tid. If its parent is found, we scan the 
child list and find the child_info of child thread. Record the exit status. 
Call sema_up() on the semaphore, and wake up the parent thread.

Then the parent thread will wake and can get the exit status of child thread 
by child_info.

Syscall_handler() in our implementation will check the validity of passed-in 
pointers before calling any syscall functions. Two helper functions we used:

static bool check_valid_pointer (void *ptr, uint8_t argc);
static bool check_valid_string (char *str);

The first function we call in syscall_handler(), it will checks esp and the 
address of the syscall arguments after it. If any of these pointers is not in 
user address or is not mapped to the thread page directory, it is considered as 
a bad pointer and we will call syscall_exit(-1). 

The second function is to deal with bad strings, it is called in before calling
the syscalls which has strings to pass in. 
Take syscall_open() as an example, we need to malloc space in this syscall. 
However, it is called only when the passed-in filename is valid, and allocated
space will be freed when file is closed or when process exit.

To deal with lock issue, we have made efforts to reduce the code in the
critical section, we usually only keep functions in file.h, filesys.h in the
critical section, these functions will not cause process to terminate. Thus,
we will not need to release lock if an error occurs since all the errors occur
before we acquire a lock.

To ensure that we have freed all the allocated resources, we free all the 
resources of child process in syscall_exit() and close and free all file
descriptors in process_exit(), which is called inside syscall_exit(). Since
when any error occured, syscall_exit(-1) will be called. Therefore, we can
make sure that all temporarily allocated resources are freed.

In addition, there are cases that our bad-pointer detection functions cannot 
handle. In these cases, we let exception.c do the job for us. Since bad pointer
will cause page fault, we modify codes in exception.c. In spite of just kill
the current process, we use syscall_exit(-1) to terminate the process when 
page fault addr is accessed by user and is kernel address. Since we call
syscall_exit(-1), all the temporarily allocated resources are freed.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable

A int variable called "child_load" is added into struct thread and will be
initialized to 0 when thread is initialized.

A semaphore called "load_sema" is added into struct thread and will be 
initialized to value 0 when thread is initialized.

When a perent thread call exec(), after called process_exec(), the child 
thread is created but not loaded. Then the parent thread call sema_down()
on "load_sema", because "load_sema" is initialized to 0. The parent thread 
will be blocked.

After the child thread loading, we can know if the child thread load 
successfully. If it is load successfully, we change the "child_load" to
1, otherwise to -1. Then get its parent thread using parent tid. Call 
sema_up() on the "load_sema" of the parent thread to wake up the parent 
thread.

When the parent thread continues running, it can know whether the child thread
is loaded successfully through "load_sema".

Note that if the child thread is loaded unsuccessfully, the exit status should
be set to -1.

If P calls wait(C) before C exits, it will be blocked due to sema_down().
Only when C exits and do sema_up(), P can wake up. This situation do
sema_down() first and sema_up() then.

If P calls wait(C) after C exits, because when C exits, it will call 
sema_up(), the value of semaphore is set to 1. When P calls wait(C) and 
do sema_down(), the value is 1. Then the parent thread won't be blocked 
and continue running.

When the parent thread creates child thread, we will create a "child_info"
and put it into the child list of the parent thread. So only parent thread
can access the resources. And this "child_info" instance is independent of 
child thread.

So if a parent thread is exiting, it should free all the "child_info"
resources in child list. Since the "child_info" instance is independent of
child thread, freeing the resources does not influence the child thread.

If P terminates without waiting before C exits. P will free the "child_info"
of C. Then because P exits, C would never be waited, which is satisfiable.

If P terminates without waiting after C exits, it can free all the 
"child_info" through child list can won't touch child thread. 

The special case is that the child thread fails loading, it creates the
"child_info" but the child thread will call exit() immediately. In this case,
it may waste some memory, but won't cause memory leak, since "child_info" is 
under the parent thread's control and will be freed eventually.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

Validating the pointer before using it is much easier for use to implement
the bad pointer checking. We do not clearly know how to really modify the 
code in exception.c with the help of get_user() and put_user() provided by
the doc. So we simply implement the straightforward method.

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

Advantages:
1. Easy to know open files belong to which thread, make things simple when 
closing files of a specific thread.

Disadvantages:
1. Consume thread struct's space, when there are lot threads, thread context
switch may be slow.

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

We didn't change the mapping.
